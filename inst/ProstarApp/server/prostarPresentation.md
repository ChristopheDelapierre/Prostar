## Data management
* **Loading**: xxx
* **Conversion**: to convert xxx
* **Export**: xxx (data/results)
* **Demo data**: xxx

## Data processing
* **Filtering**: to prune the protein or peptide list according to 
                various criteria (missing values, contaminants, reverse sequences);
* **Normalization**: to correct batch or group effects.
* **Imputation**: xxx
* **Aggregation**: for peptide-level datasets, it is possible to estimate protein abundances.
* **Hypothesis testing**: to compute the significance of each protein differential abundance.

## Data mining
* **Descriptive statistics**: available at any stage of the anayslys, for data exploration and visualization.
* **Differential analysis**: to select a list of differentially abundant proteins with a controlled false discovery rate.
* **Gene Ontology analysis**: to  map a protein list onto GO terms and test category enrichment.
